                James Barnes was born on March 10, 1917 and was the eldest child of four. Barnes grew up to be an
                overachiever, having been an excellent athlete who also excelled inside the classroom.[2] Sometime
                during his childhood, he met Steve Rogers when bullies were trying to steal his money.[12] The two
                became best friends and stuck together for many years, with Barnes often defending Rogers from bullies
                who would have attempted to take advantage of Rogers' short height and small build

            <h3 class="kallu">
                After one of their trips together to Rockaway Beach, Barnes and Rogers had ended up being forced to get
                a ride back towards Brooklyn on the back of a freezer truck as they had used all their remaining train
                money to buy hot dogs, while Barnes had also inadvertently managed to spend three dollars as he
                attempted to win a stuffed bear for Dolores.[3] Another time when they went to Coney Island together,
                Barnes convinced Rogers to ride the Cyclone, which resulted in Rogers throwing up due to the ride, much
                to Barnes' great amusement.[1]

                Prior to his brainwashing, Bucky Barnes was extremely devoted, loyal, headstrong, and patriotic with a
                strong moral center. He was a good and close friend to Steve Rogers during their youth; he helped him
                when he got into fights and tried to cheer him up and look after him when Rogers' mother died. Best
                friends since childhood, they went through many trials and tribulations together. He was also protective
                of Rogers, as demonstrated when Steve planned to enlist in the United States Army. Barnes tried to talk
                him out of it, as he knew he would die because of his physical condition and poor health.

                Regardless of their many differences, Barnes has developed a close bond with Wilson during their
                struggle against the Flag Smashers, with Barnes later voluntarily helping him fix the Paul & Darlene
                family boat, and with Wilson subsequently inviting Barnes to sleep over at the Wilson Family Residence.
                After helping him practice throwing the shield, Barnes sincerely apologizes to Wilson, stating that he
                now realizes the pressure that Wilson was under after Rogers initially gave him the shield. Barnes also
                confesses about his nightmares, showing his newly developed trust in Wilson.
